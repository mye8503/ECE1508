DQN is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with 
deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function Q(s,a). It is 
particularly effective for discrete action spaces, making it well-suited for 
trading decisions such as buy, sell, or hold. By using experience replay and a 
target network, DQN stabilizes training and improves sample efficiency. In the 
context of stock trading, DQN allows the agent to learn complex patterns in 
historical market data and optimize actions to maximize cumulative portfolio returns.
